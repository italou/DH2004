[skill_comments_Tracking]       Tracking is the ability to follow an animal that has already been identified.  As this skill improves, the hunter will see more tracks and blood.
[skill_comments_Stealth]        The stealth ability allows the hunter to make less noise, both audible and visual.
[skill_comments_Calling]        Higher calling ability makes the hunter’s calls more effective, particularly with larger animals.  It also gives less chance of “blowing” a call, which will frighten away the animal instead of calling it in.
[skill_comments_Presence]       Presence is gained through long periods of dedication to and study of nature.  The hunter who is more in tune with nature and his prey has a better chance of success in his hunts.  Higher presence will enhance the hunter's other abilities.  A higher presence score will allow the player to discover more animal signs.  The player will also distinguish sounds of animals more distinctly than ambiental sounds.
[skill_comments_Hardiness]      A hardier hunter will move faster, especially when carrying heavy weight like the tripod.
[skill_comments_Horsemanship]   A higher horsemanship allows the player to ride faster, mount and unmount quicker, climb and descend steeper slopes.
[skill_comments_Weapons]        The weapons skill is a general skill that applies to all weapons.  A higher weapons skill gives a quicker preparation time, faster reload time, better control of the weapon, and quicker recovery after the shot. 
[skill_comments_Strength]       This represents the physical force of the hunter.  A higher strength will allow the player to run faster, change positions more quickly, set up stands and tripods more quickly, and handle weapons better which require more physical force, such as bows handguns and high-caliber rifles.
[skill_comments_Stamina]        A higher stamina allows the hunter to run longer without tiring.
